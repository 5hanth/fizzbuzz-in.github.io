FizzBuzz is a programming workshop for Ruby beginners. You'll learn to solve programming puzzles using the Ruby programming language, and have some fun while doing it.

We'll start with a simple FizzBuzz implementation, and then move through a few more difficult problems - all the way up to to writing Fuzzy Search eventually (see *Agenda* below).

The goal is to enable you tackle  programming interviews using Ruby, and to also demonstrate the power and elegance of Ruby.
